Lets create a list of my inspiring movies/documentaries list. Whenever I feel low, pick a random video from the list and I pick something new from these movies. I'm sure everyone has something to get a bite of it. This is not a comprehensive list but a just of the top of my mind. I will try to keep frequently update.



- [Coach Carter]
- [Good Will Hunting]
- [Hello I am David] / [Shine]
- [The Real Miyagi]
- [Top spin]
- [Moneyball]
- [The Terminal]
