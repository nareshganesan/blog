This is my first blog post using [Hugo], the new static site generator.  I've always to wanted to start blog to share and learn.
Its never late than now. :) Hugo is really neat, simple and easy to install. Learning curve is easy to moderate, 
depends on the person. I will write more about the Hugo in my future posts.

Currently, I'm in the process of building the blog template, so will be making more changes to the template.
